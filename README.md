# Reduction 

Simple-ish boilerplate for react/redux applications using Webpack as the build
tool. Includes an `.eslintrc` file for those using ESLint as their linter.

Check out the `with-react-router` branch for boilerplate using React Router and
[redux-simple-router](https://github.com/rackt/redux-simple-router). 

What follows are usage guides and then notes about the various files. 

## Usage 

First clone this repo and cd into the root of the project. Then 
```
npm install
```
then 
```
webpack-dev-server
```
then go to `localhost:8080`. Everything is working if you see the word 'default' on
the screen and if clicking it changes what you see to 
```
Hello from app!
new prop
```

## `package.json`

A few things to take note of here. First, some things that others would put in
`dev-dependencies` are in `dependencies`. For example, `webpack` and its associated
loaders (`sass-loader`, `css-loader`, etc). Whether to put these in
`dev-dependencies` or `dependencies` depends on what you want to do. If you're
going to be bundling from your source in your production environment, they should
stay in `dependencies`. If, on the other hand, you're going to be bundling first
and then sending the whole compiled bundle over to your production server, then you
should put them all in `dev-dependencies`. 

The only things I've put in `dev-dependencies` are `react-hot-loader` and
`webpack-dev-server`, which you would only use in development. 

Additionally, I've included loaders for building with Sass in Webpack. If you
aren't using Sass, you can take those out (note: `node-sass` is there as a peer
dependency of `sass-loader`). 

Finally, the script `prod` which you would run from the command line using `npm run
prod` causes Webpack to bundle using the `webpack.production.config.js` config
file, which leaves things like hot module replacement and webpack-dev-server out of
it. So, you use this to bundle for production and just plain old `webpack` (or
`webpack-dev-server` on the command line to bundle in development. 

## `webpack.config.js` 

Configures webpack to run with webpack-dev-server serving on port 8080. Also, comes
ready to compile css and sass into your bundle. The config assumes that
`src/index.jsx` is the entry point to the app, and it will bundle everything to
`dist/bundle.js`. Run `webpack` from the command line to put the bundle together
without serving it up. Run `webpack-dev-server` to bundle and serve from
`localhost:8080` with hot module replacement and react hot loading (ie, changes you
save to your files will be reflected in your app without having to reload the
page). 

## `webpack.production.config.js` 

A webpack config file more suitable for production. It doesn't include the
hot-loaders and doesn't configure the dev server. Basically, it's stripped down to
just build and get out of the way. Use this with the command `npm run prod`. 

## `src/index.jsx`

This functions as the main entry point for the app. It is also where the store is
created from our reducers and some middleware. In a larger app where you might have
multiple reducers combined, you would likely make a store-creating function in a
different file and then import it here. I've also included a store with Thunk
middleware so that this app will be ready to go with async actions in the action
creators (in `actions/index.jsx`), which requires Thunk middleware so that an
action creator can return a function rather than an object as it normally would.

Note the addition of a `routing` reducer that enables the use of
`redux-simple-router` to enable things like the `pushPath` action creator (which is
passed to our main App element) and keeping the Redux store and routes in sync.

## `src/actions/index.jsx`

Action types are declared and exported at the top and these are followed by action
creators. Note that in a larger app you might want to have all the action types
declared in a `constants` file and them imported. The only action creator of note is `performAsyncAction` which
demonstrates the pattern to use with Thunk middleware and async actions. Typically,
this would be something like an API call rather than a `setTimeout`, which I've
used for an example. 

The basic idea is that this kind of action creator returns a function which takes
the `dispatch` function as callback. If first dispatches the action which tells the
app that the async action has begun. This action might (in the reducer) change a
prop called 'isFetching' from `false` to `true`. It then is set up to dispatch
other action creators as well. If this were an api call with success and error
callbacks (Promises) you might dispatch a `apiSuccess` action creator in the
success callback and a `apiError` action creator in the error callback. All of this
is so that when the async action completes, the state is updated accordingly. 

## `src/reducers/reducer.js` 

Template for standard Redux reducer, including handling of async requests with
switching on and off an `isFetching` state prop. Note that I'm simply using
`Object.assign` to create new states and keep the code functional, rather than a
library like `Immutable.js`. 

## `src/containers/App.jsx`

Connects the main app to the Redux store and also binds action creators so that
they can be passed down to a child component without that child component being
connected to Redux. It does this with `bindActionCreators`, which allows for an
action creator to be called and `dispatch` to the store without the component
inside of which it is called needing to itself call `dispatch` on the action (the
`dispatch` method is given to connected components). 

Also contains an example usage of `redux-simple-router`'s `pushPath` action
creator, which can be used to change routes from inside a component without the use
of React Router's `Link` components. 

## `src/containers/Root.jsx`

Serves as the root route for our React router routing scheme. Also contains example
usages of `Link` elements for changing routes. 

## `src/components/ExampleComponent.jsx` 

A very simple component that includes a click handler to illustrate how an action
creator passed down using `bindActionCreators` could be used. It also calls the
stand-in async action on click.  

## `src/styles/`

Just placeholder scss files. A css reset is included because I use them sometimes. Otherwise it's just a more or
less empty stylesheet.

# Testing 

A testing framework is set up to use Karma as the test runner and mocha/chai as the
actual test framework/assertion library. This involves using karma-webpack to allow
Karma to work with Webpack. Included as well is `karma-chai-plugins` which brings
along chai, chai-as-promised, sinon-chai, and others, all loaded in `karma.conf.js`
with `karma-chai-plugins`. 

There are very few tests included - they're they just to show the boilerplate and
test framework are set up correctly and provide some patterns for more tests. Since
this is boilerplate, extensive testing makes less sense. 

To run the tests, from root of project do `npm test` (or `karma start` if you
prefer). 

One Webpack specific thing about the way we're using Karma is to be found in the
`tests.bundle.js` file. This file bundles allows Webpack to bundle all our test
files into one so tests can be run against them (this bundle is loaded as a
separate 'chunk' from our main app bundle). This is the only entry file we need to
put in `karma.conf.js` -- to add new test files all we need to do is make sure they
match the file glob given in `tests.bundle.js`, which in this case is
`*.spec.jsx?$`, that is, a filename that ends with either `.spec.js` or
`.spec.jsx`.
